This information is not so easy to access and summarize in order to satisfy the demands and provide useful information for the clients.\n\nExamples of different real state clients demands concerning locations are:\n\n* How many primary, high schols are there for my kids? Are there parks around?\n* Are there many bars and restaurants around in order to enjoy the night life?\n* How about cultural locations. I love to go to the teather and cinemas. Are There many options around?\n\n**The general question to ask is: How can we provide useful information about locations regarding a specific real state client demand. In other words, Is the future accommodation suitable for a client specific needs?**\n\nWe can identify different kind of needs. We start to define three kind of needs or sc\u00e9narios:\n\n* Family environments: is the location suitable for kids and families?. Are there any parks, schools, is it safe?\n* Nightlife environments: is the location suibale for a person that enjoys go out frequently. How many bars, restaurants, discos are there\n* Cultural environents: is the location suitable to enjoy cultural activities. How many museums, cinemas, theaters are there?\n\nThis solution also compares how any particular location is similar to another concerning these sc\u00e9narios "

After some web investigation we can say that the city of Paris is divided by (arrondissements) wich are the districts and \"quartiers\" which we can translate by neighborhoods. \n\n\n* *Location venues:* we need to get a dataset that provides all the different kinds of venues for a particular location.

This public data source offers the opportunity to obtain the dataset in different formats (csv, json, excel, etc). We are going to get the csv file. This file we will provide the district number, neighboorhood name and coordinates (lat and long). **This is the method that I will use since it provides all the necessary information**\n    \n    \n* For the venues:\n    - As we said we are going to use the Foursquare dataset. We are going to use the API and we are going to use the explore url request: \n        \n    https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&ll=LATITUDE,LONGITUDE&v=VERSION&limit=LIMIT\n    \n    \n* The latitude and longtide information is getted in the demographic dataset\n"
